defmodule Membrane.Pipeline.Spec do
  @moduledoc """
  Structure representing topology of a pipeline. It can be returned from
  `Membrane.Pipeline.handle_init/1` callback upon pipeline's initialization.
  It will define a topology of children and links that build the pipeline.

  ## Children

  Children that should be spawned when the pipeline starts can be defined
  with the `:children` field.

  You have to set it to a keyword list, where keys are valid element name
  that is unique within this pipeline and values are either element's module or
  struct of that module.

  Sample definitions:

      [
        first_element: %Element.With.Options.Struct{option_a: 42},
        some_element: Element.Without.Options,
        other_element: Element.Using.Default.Options
      ]

  ## Links

  Links that should be made when the pipeline starts, and children are spawned
  can be defined with the `:links` field.

  You have to set it to a map, where both keys and values are tuples of
  `{element_name, pad_name}`. Values can also have additional options passed by
  keyword list at the end (See `t:link_option_t/0`).
  Element names have to match names given to the `:children` field.

  Once it's done, pipeline will ensure that links are present.

  Sample definition:

      %{
        {:source,     :source} => {:converter,  :sink, pull_buffer: [preferred_size: 20_000]},
        {:converter,  :source} => {:aggregator, :sink},
        {:aggregator, :source} => {:converter,  :sink},
      }
