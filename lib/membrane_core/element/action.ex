defmodule Membrane.Element.Action do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains type specifications of actions that can be returned
  from element callbacks.

  Returning actions is a way of element interaction with
  other elements and parts of framework. Each action may be returned by any
  callback (except for `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.CommonBehaviour.handle_init`
  and `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.CommonBehaviour.handle_terminate`, as they
  do not return any actions) unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  @typedoc """
  Sends a message to the pipeline.
  """
  @type message_t :: {:message, Message.t()}

  @typedoc """
  Sends an event through a pad (sink or source).

  Forbidden when playback state is stopped.
  """
  @type event_t :: {:event, {Pad.name_t(), Event.t()}}

  @typedoc """
  Allows to split callback execution into multiple applications of another callback
  (called from now sub-callback).

  Executions are synchronous in the element process, and each of them passes
  subsequent arguments from the args_list, along with the element state (passed
  as the last argument each time).

  Return value of each execution of sub-callback can be any valid return value
  of the original callback (this also means sub-callback can return any action
  valid for the original callback, unless expliciltly stated). Returned actions
  are executed immediately (their are NOT accumulated and executed after all
  sub-callback executions are finished).

  Useful when a long action is to be undertaken, and partial results need to
  be returned before entire process finishes (e.g. default implementation of
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Filter.handle_process/4` uses split action to invoke
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Filter.handle_process1/4` with each buffer)

  Sends caps through a pad (it must be source pad). Sended caps must fit
  constraints on the pad.

  Forbidden when playback state is stopped.

  @typedoc """
  Sends buffers through a pad (it must be source pad).

  Allowed only when playback state is playing.
  """
  @type buffer_t :: {:buffer, {Pad.name_t(), Buffer.t() | [Buffer.t()]}}

  @typedoc """
  Makes a demand on a pad (it must be sink pad in pull mode). It does NOT
  entail _sending_ demand through the pad, but just _requesting_ some amount
  of data from `Membrane.PullBuffer`, which _sends_ demands automatically when it
  runs out of data.
  If there is any data available at the pad, the data is passed to
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Filter.handle_process/4`
  or `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Sink.handle_write/4` callback. Invoked callback is
  guaranteed not to receive more data than demanded.

  Depending on element type and callback, it may contain different payloads or
  behave differently:

  In sinks:
  - Payload `{pad, size}` increases demand on given pad by given size.
  - Payload `{pad, {:set_to, size}}` erases current demand and sets it to given size.

  In filters:
  - Payload `{pad, size}` is only allowed from
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.SourceBehaviour.handle_demand/5` callback. It overrides
  current demand.
  - Payload `{pad, {{:source, demanding_source_pad}, size}}` can be returned from
  any callback. `demanding_source_pad` is a pad which is to receive demanded
  buffers after they are processed.
  - Payload `{pad, :self, size}` makes demand act as if element was a sink,
  that is extends demand on a given pad. Buffers received as a result of the
  demand should be consumed by element itself or sent through a pad in `push` mode.
  - Payload `{pad, :self, {:set_to, size}}` do almost the same as the previous
  one, but it sets a demand on a given pad (not extends the previous demand).

  Allowed only when playback state is playing.

  Executes `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.SourceBehaviour.handle_demand/5` callback with
  given pad (which must be a source pad in pull mode) if this demand is greater
  than 0.

  Useful when demand could not have been supplied when previous call to

  element-specific circumstances changed and it might be possible to supply
  it (at least partially).

  @type redemand_t :: {:redemand, Pad.name_t()}

  @typedoc """
  Sends buffers/caps/event to all source pads of element (or to sink pads when
  event occurs on the source pad). Used by default implementations of
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.SinkBehaviour.handle_caps/4` and
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.CommonBehaviour.handle_event/4` callbacks in filter.

  Allowed only when _all_ below conditions are met:
  - element is filter,
  - callback is `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Filter.handle_process/4`,
  `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.SinkBehaviour.handle_caps/4`
  or `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.CommonBehaviour.handle_event/4`,
  - playback state is valid for sending buffer, caps or event action
  respectively.

  Keep in mind that `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Filter.handle_process/4` can only
  forward buffers, `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.SinkBehaviour.handle_caps/4` - caps
  and `c:Membrane.Element.Base.Mixin.CommonBehaviour.handle_event/4` - events.

  - `playback_change: :resume` may be returned from any callback, only when
  playback state change is suspended, and causes it to finish.

  that it may affect application quality if not done quick enough.
