# Membrane Multimedia Framework

Multimedia processing framework that focuses on reliability, concurrency and scalability.

An easy to use abstraction layer for assembling mostly server-side applications that have to consume, produce or process multimedia streams.

It puts reliability over amount of features.

It is written in Elixir + C with outstanding Erlang VM underneath that gives us a rock solid and battle tested foundation.
